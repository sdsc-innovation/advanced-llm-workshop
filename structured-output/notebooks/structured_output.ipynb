      "Tepotinib is approved for the treatment of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer harboring *MET* exon 14 skipping alterations. While edema is the most prevalent adverse event (AE) and a known class effect of MET inhibitors including tepotinib, there is still limited understanding about the factors contributing to its occurrence. Herein, we apply machine learning (ML)-based approaches to predict the likelihood of occurrence of edema in patients undergoing tepotinib treatment, and to identify factors influencing its development over time. Data from 612 patients receiving tepotinib in five Phase I/II studies were modeled with two ML algorithms, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Trees, to predict edema AE incidence and severity. Probability calibration was applied to give a realistic estimation of the likelihood of edema AE. Best model was tested on follow-up data and on data from clinical studies unused while training. Results showed high performances across all the tested settings, with F1 scores up to 0.961 when retraining the model with the most relevant covariates. The use of ML explainability methods identified serum albumin as the most informative longitudinal covariate, and higher age as associated with higher probabilities of more severe edema. The developed methodological framework enables the use of ML algorithms for analyzing clinical safety data and exploiting longitudinal information through various covariate engineering approaches. Probability calibration ensures the accurate estimation of the likelihood of the AE occurrence, while explainability tools can identify factors contributing to model predictions, hence supporting population and individual patient-level interpretation.\n",

      "# **INTRODUCTION**\n",
      "\n",
      "Drug-disease models play a pivotal role in quantitative understanding of the trajectory of disease pathophysiology and the effects of drug treatment. These empirical or mechanistic models, often requiring the abstraction of data into dynamical systems, have proven to be valuable tools in drug development and therapeutic research.[1](#page-10-0) However, their ability to mathematically describe complex datasets is highly dependent on the availability, quality, and quantity of data, and on the assumptions made by the modeler[.2](#page-10-1) In parallel, the recent digital healthcare revolution has significantly expanded the opportunities to collect diverse, multimodal, high-dimensional data, including clinical information, multi-omics data, electronic health records, and imaging data, enabling advancements in precision medicine.[3-5](#page-10-2) While this presents new opportunities to enhance drug development efficiency and improve patient care, it also poses a new challenge for traditional modeling approaches. Indeed, extracting meaningful insights from such vast volumes of diverse data has become increasingly difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this context, machine learning (ML) approaches have emerged as promising in advancing understanding in drug and disease in the context of drug development, while complementing and enhancing conventional approaches like pharmacometrics models[.6](#page-10-3) ML models are universal, nonlinear, function approximation tools capable of learning patterns from empirical data by exploiting highly dimensional input spaces, that is, potentially incorporating a large number of covariates within the model.[7,8](#page-10-4) Moreover, no assumptions on data distributions or on the biological process driving the studied phenomena must be a priori taken, as ML models are fully data driven. Such characteristics neatly distinguish ML algorithms from other non-mechanistic models and traditional statistical approaches.[9](#page-10-5) Many ML applications have already proven effective in modeling the occurrence of events or clinical outcomes along with baseline covariate values. However, there is still not a shared unified pipeline for ML application on longitudinal clinical data.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this study, a framework to apply ML approaches to the prediction of longitudinal clinical end points is proposed. The framework is presented via an application on the case study of tepotinib, a highly selective, potent, orally available, reversible, type Ib adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive, small molecule inhibitor of the mesenchymal–epithelial transition factor (MET)[.10](#page-10-6) Tepotinib inhibits hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-dependent and -independent MET tyrosine kinase signaling by blocking MET phosphorylation, and showed antitumor activity in multiple tumor models derived from diverse cancer types.[11,12](#page-10-7) The antitumor activity of tepotinib is particularly pronounced in tumors with oncogenic alterations of *MET*, such as *MET* exon 14 (*MET*ex14) skipping and highlevel *MET* amplification. Based on results from the Phase II VISION (NCT02864992) clinical trial,[13-16](#page-10-8) tepotinib is approved in multiple regions for the treatment of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with *MET*ex14 skipping alterations, representing ~3–4% of this type of cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previous clinical studies have revealed edema as the most prevalent adverse event and a known class effect of MET inhibitors including tepotinib.[17,18](#page-10-9) However, the\n",
      "\n",
      "links between the participants' clinical history, the time and duration of tepotinib treatment, and the occurrence of edema remain unclear, and understanding the effect of dose modifications to mitigate such adverse event is the object of ongoing investigations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The objectives of this study were twofold. First, ML models were tested to predict the occurrence of edema grade in patients undergoing tepotinib treatment. To this aim, a framework to apply classical ML approaches to the specific task of edema prediction was designed. In doing so, two ML models belonging to the family of classification trees algorithm, namely Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT), were applied and benchmarked. Classification trees are known to outperform more complex models, including neural networks, when used for prediction tasks on structured tabular data such as those collected for the present study.[19](#page-10-10) However, they are not able to intrinsically account for the longitudinal dimension characterizing clinical data. To overcome this limitation, different ways of introducing the temporal dimension into the model via covariate engineering were evaluated. The performances of the best predictive model were verified on longer term follow-up data, and on data for a different set of patients. Finally, the model was retrained including the entire dataset and only on a reduced set of the most relevant input covariates.\n",

While edema is the most prevalent adverse event (AE) and a known class effect of MET inhibitors including tepotinib, there is still limited understanding about the factors contributing to its occurrence. Herein, we apply machine learning (ML)-based approaches to predict the likelihood of occurrence of edema in patients undergoing tepotinib treatment, and to identify factors influencing its development over time. Data from 612 patients receiving tepotinib in five Phase I/II studies were modeled with two ML algorithms, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Trees, to predict edema AE incidence and severity. Probability calibration was applied to give a realistic estimation of the likelihood of edema AE. Best model was tested on follow-up data and on data from clinical studies unused while training. Results showed high performances across all the tested settings, with F1 scores up to 0.961 when retraining the model with the most relevant covariates. The use of ML explainability methods identified serum albumin as the most informative longitudinal covariate, and higher age as associated with higher probabilities of more severe edema. The developed methodological framework enables the use of ML algorithms for analyzing clinical safety data and exploiting longitudinal information through various covariate engineering approaches. Probability calibration ensures the accurate estimation of the likelihood of the AE occurrence, while explainability tools can identify factors contributing to model predictions, hence supporting population and individual patient-level interpretation.\"\n",

Results showed high performances across all the tested settings, with F1 scores up to 0.961 when retraining the model with the most relevant covariates. The use of ML explainability methods identified serum albumin as the most informative longitudinal covariate, and higher age as associated with higher probabilities of more severe edema. The developed methodological framework enables the use of ML algorithms for analyzing clinical safety data and exploiting longitudinal information through various covariate engineering approaches. Probability calibration ensures the accurate estimation of the likelihood of the AE occurrence, while explainability tools can identify factors contributing to model predictions, hence supporting population and individual patient-level interpretation.\"\n",

While edema is the most prevalent adverse event (AE) and a known class effect of MET inhibitors including tepotinib, there is still limited understanding about the factors contributing to its occurrence. Herein, we apply machine learning (ML)-based approaches to predict the likelihood of occurrence of edema in patients undergoing tepotinib treatment, and to identify factors influencing its development over time. Data from 612 patients receiving tepotinib in five Phase I/II studies were modeled with two ML algorithms, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Trees, to predict edema AE incidence and severity. Probability calibration was applied to give a realistic estimation of the likelihood of edema AE. Best model was tested on follow-up data and on data from clinical studies unused while training. Results showed high performances across all the tested settings, with F1 scores up to 0.961 when retraining the model with the most relevant covariates. The use of ML explainability methods identified serum albumin as the most informative longitudinal covariate, and higher age as associated with higher probabilities of more severe edema. The developed methodological framework enables the use of ML algorithms for analyzing clinical safety data and exploiting longitudinal information through various covariate engineering approaches. Probability calibration ensures the accurate estimation of the likelihood of the AE occurrence, while explainability tools can identify factors contributing to model predictions, hence supporting population and individual patient-level interpretation.'}"
