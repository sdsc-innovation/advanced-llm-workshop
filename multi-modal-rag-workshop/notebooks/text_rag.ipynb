    "1. **Improved Accuracy:** RAG enhances the factual correctness of generated responses by retrieving up-to-date and domain-specific information, reducing the likelihood of hallucinations (fabricated information).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Better Generalization:** Since RAG dynamically retrieves relevant documents, it performs well across various domains without requiring extensive fine-tuning, making it more adaptable to new topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reduced Model Size Requirements:** Instead of embedding all knowledge within a large model, RAG leverages external databases, allowing for smaller, more efficient models while maintaining high-quality responses.\n",

    "4. **Enhanced Explainability:** By referencing retrieved documents, RAG provides verifiable sources for its answers, making it more transparent and easier to trust compared to purely generative models.\n",

    "In this exercise, you will learn how to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline from scratch, without relying on tools like `langchain`. While `langchain` is a powerful framework that simplifies the development of RAG pipelines, it can sometimes lack flexibility for custom implementations, as it abstracts many components.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different components of the pipeline are:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text extraction from PDFs** – Extract raw text from PDF files to make the content processable.  \n",
    "- **Text chunking** – Break the extracted text into smaller, meaningful segments to improve retrieval efficiency.  \n",
    "- **Embedding of the chunks** – Convert text chunks into numerical representations (embeddings) using a pre-trained model.  \n",
    "- **Storage of the embeddings in a vector store** – Save the embeddings in a specialized database (vector store) to enable fast similarity searches.  \n",
    "- **Relevant chunks retrieval** – Query the vector store to find the most relevant text chunks based on user input.  \n",
    "- **Setting and prompting of the LLM for a RAG** – Structure prompts and configure the language model to integrate retrieved information into its responses.  \n",
    "- **Additional tools for improved retrieval** – Use techniques like query expansion to reformulate user queries for better recall and reciprocal rank fusion to combine results from multiple retrieval methods.  \n",
    "- **Final RAG pipeline implementation** – Integrate all components into a complete system that retrieves relevant information and generates enhanced responses using the language model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** To complete this exercise, you need an OpenAI API key, the PDF files, and the necessary libraries installed (see `requirements.txt`).  "

On the other hand, for higher albumin levels the corresponding SHAP values are mostly negative and ranging from 0 to −0.5, suggesting a reduced risk of edema of grade 2+. The association between age greater than 70years and an increased likelihood of edemas of grades 2+ was also confirmed. Additionally, for all ages, higher SHAP values were assigned to patients who experienced edemas, particularly of grade 2+. Finally, within low ranges of cumulated dose in the interval [ *t* − 14 days, *t* ] normalized over 14days, higher SHAP values were assigned to samples corresponding to edemas of grades 2+.

      "The presence of such input is ensuring high model performances when predicting persistence of a given edema grade. The sensitivity analysis to the inclusion of this input revealed a decline in the mean cross-validation F1 score of ~0.350 when it was removed as a candidate predictor. However, the use of Isotonic Regressions ensures the estimations of correctly calibrated probabilities. For instance, while low predicted probabilities, for example, for edemas of grade 2+, might lead to a classification error, they can still provide valuable details on existing risk of occurrence of an adverse event (Figure [S5\\)](#page-11-0). Moreover, sensitivity analysis together with the SHAP importance highlighted interesting patterns with respect to the exposure-related features. Referencing Figure [3](#page-7-1), lower values of the dose [ *t* − 14 days, *t* ] are associated with a decreased probability of edema of grades 2+ at subsequent visits.\n",

      "The second objective of the study was the identification of the factors predicting edema occurrence and evolution over time. The Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used to investigate the role different factors have toward a specific estimation of edema occurrence obtained via the best predictive model, both at population and patient level. The use of this approach overcomes the lack of explainability of ML models, which approximate complex nonlinear functions from data in a not straightforwardly interpretable manner.[20,21](#page-10-11) # **METHODS** # **Clinical data** Data from 612 patients enrolled in five Phase I/II clinical studies with tepotinib were collected (NCT01014936, NCT01832506, NCT01988493, NCT02115373, VISION – NCT02864992).\n",

      "Consistently with the above sensitivity analysis, past current edema grade was found to be the most influential input, particularly if a same grade persisted to the following safety visit. The exposure-derived features were also informative for the model probability predictions. Albumin was found as the most informative time-varying covariate, especially for predicting edemas of grades 2+. Figure [3](#page-7-1) illustrates the contribution of the input variables toward the predicted probability of edemas of grades 2+. The analysis reveals that the current edema grade is the most informative input, as patients with a history of edemas of grades 2+ are considered highly likely to experience the same grade in the future. Interestingly, albumin once again emerges as the most informative among the longitudinal covariates, with lower levels associated <span id=\"page-6-0\"></span>\n",

      "Moreover, age impact on predictions appears to have an evident pattern, with older subjects associated with an increased probability of edemas of grade 2+. Figure [4](#page-8-0) illustrates the relationship between albumin, age, the [ *t* − 14 days, *t* ] cumulated dose normalized over 14days, and their corresponding SHAP values for predicting the likelihood of edemas of grades 2+. For lower albumin levels, positive SHAP contributions between 0 and 0.5 are consistently assigned, signifying an increased risk of developing edema of grade 2+.

I also looked at Document 2 for article citation and additional context. Document 5 provides insights into the SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) values, which indicate how the model interprets the importance of different inputs in predicting edema. This combination of information helps in understanding the machine learning approach taken in the study.\",\n",
