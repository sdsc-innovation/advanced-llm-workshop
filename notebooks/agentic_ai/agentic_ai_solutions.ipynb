You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\\n\\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\\n\\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\\n\\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\\n\\nAction:\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\\n}\\n\\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\\nAction:\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\\n}\\n\\n\\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\\n---\\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\\n\\nAction:\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\\n}\\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\\n\\nAction:\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\\n}\\nObservation: \"image.png\"\\n\\nAction:\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\\n}\\n\\n---\\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\\n\\nAction:\\n{\\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\\n}\\nObservation: 1302.678\\n\\nAction:\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\\n}\\n\\n---\\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\\n\\nAction:\\n{\\n    \"name\": \"search\",\\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\\n}\\nObservation: [\\'Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.\\']\\n\\n\\nAction:\\n{\\n    \"name\": \"search\",\\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\\n}\\nObservation: \\'26 million (2019)\\'\\n\\nAction:\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\\n}\\n\\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\\n3.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\\n\\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\\n\\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\\n\\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\\n\\nAction:\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\\n}\\n\\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\\nAction:\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\\n}\\n\\n\\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\\n---\\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\\n\\nAction:\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\\n}\\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\\n\\nAction:\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\\n}\\nObservation: \"image.png\"\\n\\nAction:\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\\n}\\n\\n---\\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\\n\\nAction:\\n{\\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\\n}\\nObservation: 1302.678\\n\\nAction:\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\\n}\\n\\n---\\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\\n\\nAction:\\n{\\n    \"name\": \"search\",\\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\\n}\\nObservation: [\\'Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.\\']\\n\\n\\nAction:\\n{\\n    \"name\": \"search\",\\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\\n}\\nObservation: \\'26 million (2019)\\'\\n\\nAction:\\n{\\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\\n}\\n\\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\\n- visit_webpage: Visits a webpage at the given url and reads its content as a markdown string. Use this to browse webpages.\\n    Takes inputs: {\\'url\\': {\\'type\\': \\'string\\', \\'description\\': \\'The url of the webpage to visit.\\'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {\\'answer\\': {\\'type\\': \\'any\\', \\'description\\': \\'The final answer to the problem\\'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\\n4.

Subsequent work has extended this finding to additional mitochondrial diseases and more common conditions. However, challenges inherent to gas-based therapies have hindered the rapid translation of our findings to the clinic. Here, we tested a small molecule (hereafter termed HypoxyStat) that increases the binding affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, thereby decreasing oxygen offloading to tissues. Daily oral dosing of HypoxyStat caused systemic hypoxia in mice breathing normoxic (21% O2) air. When administered prior to disease onset, this treatment dramatically extended the lifespan of Ndufs4 KO mice and rescued additional aspects of disease, including behavior, body weight, neuropathology, and body temperature. HypoxyStat was also able to reverse disease at a very late stage, thereby serving as a clinically tractable form of hypoxia therapy.\\n\\n# INTRODUCTION\\n\\nOxygen serves as a substrate for over 200 biochemical reactions, making it essential for human health.<sup>1</sup> However, excess oxygen is also toxic.<sup>2</sup> We recently demonstrated that mitochondrial diseases reduce whole-body oxygen consumption, leading to an imbalance between oxygen supply and demand.3–5 This imbalance results in tissue hyperoxia, as observed in the leading mouse model of mitochondrial disease, the *Ndufs4* knockout (KO) mouse. This model lacks an essential complex 1 subunit of the electron transport chain (ETC) and reproduces the pathology of Leigh syndrome, the most common pediatric mitochondrial disease. Similar findings of hyperoxia are evident in mitochondrial disease patients that exhibit elevated venous oxygen levels due to impaired tissue oxygen extraction.<sup>6</sup> Notably, we have shown that chronic exposure to inhaled hypoxia (equivalent to an altitude of 4,500 m) normalizes this tissue hyperoxia and dramatically extends the lifespan of *Ndufs4* KO mice.3,5 Remarkably, this intervention can even reverse neurological lesions at the late stages of disease.<sup>4</sup>\\n\\nRecent studies have further highlighted the therapeutic potential of hypoxia in mitochondrial disorders. For example, hypoxia has been shown to mitigate motor defects in a Friedreich\\'s ataxia mouse model.<sup>7</sup> Additionally, our genome-wide CRISPR screen comparing hypoxia with normoxia identified over 75 additional monogenic disorders that could potentially benefit from hypoxia therapy.<sup>8</sup> Beyond inborn errors of metabolism, we recently demonstrated that chronic hypoxia alleviates many aspects of metabolic syndrome.<sup>9</sup> These findings align with epidemiological data showing a reduced incidence of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes in populations living at high altitudes.10–18 Taken together, these results suggest that hypoxia may represent a therapeutic approach for a broad range of diseases, from rare genetic disorders to more common conditions.\\n\\nBuilding on these discoveries, phase 1 clinical trials were recently completed to assess the feasibility of inhaled hypoxia therapy.<sup>19</sup> Patients were gradually acclimated to hypoxic conditions until they reached an arterial oxygen saturation (SaO₂) of 85%. This exposure was well-tolerated, consistent with the fact that humans have resided at altitude for centuries.<sup>20</sup> Nevertheless, maintaining patients in a state of chronic hypoxia presents significant logistical challenges, underscoring the need to develop more practical approaches to hypoxia-based therapies.\\n\\nOur previous research indicated that patients with mitochondrial disease would likely require continuous hypoxia throughout most of the day, making intermittent hypoxia or approaches such as \\'\\'sleeping in hypoxia\\'\\' insufficient.<sup>4</sup> Although relocating\\n\\n<span id=\"page-0-4\"></span><sup>5</sup>Lead contact'"

While edema is the most prevalent adverse event (AE) and a known class effect of MET inhibitors including tepotinib, there is still limited understanding about the factors contributing to its occurrence. Herein, we apply machine learning (ML)-based approaches to predict the likelihood of occurrence of edema in patients undergoing tepotinib treatment, and to identify factors influencing its development over time.', metadata={'source_text': 'Explainable_machine_learning_prediction_of_edema_a.pdf', 'document_chunk_id': 1}, data_type=<DataType.TEXT: 'text'>, score=None)}]]"
